QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000006	泰斯拉把木頭雕刻成我們的樣子。{nl}所以我們一直都想好好報答他的恩惠。{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000007	所以我說。我有事相求。{nl}能不能幫我收集大教堂的大理石雕像然後轉交給泰斯拉呢？

QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000010	總之…難怪好像有客人來的樣子，謝謝啊。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000011	我第一次在柯拉佩達見到你的時候，我就在想你真的能用那纖細的手臂揮動劍嗎？{nl}不過現在都成為了人人歌頌的勇士了。{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000012	但我還是想確認看看你的勇氣。{nl}報喪女妖讓邪惡氣息瀰漫著整個黑暗森林…對你來說應該是個剛剛好的挑戰吧！
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000013	不怎麼樣嘛！只不過是狩獵而已。{nl}他應該會在柯拉佩達等你喔！
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000014	來了啊！我一直在等你呢！{nl}這是符合你勇氣的獎勵。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000015	呼呼，真是認真啊！{nl}我突然想起你還是實習法師的時候。那時候你真的很認真呢…{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000016	我很好奇你現在究竟進不了多少。{nl}汙染這黑暗森林的報喪女妖對你來說應該是個適當的挑戰吧？
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000017	我覺得比起考試這是做好事。{nl}那麼下次在柯拉佩達見囉！
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000018	不錯，消滅的很乾脆。{nl}下次見面的時候我是否會更好奇你變成甚麼樣了呢？

QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000020	我想看看你是不是真的實力如其名，跟我打個賭吧！？{nl}把汙染這森林的報喪女妖全都消滅吧怎麼樣？
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000021	其時打賭才沒那麼重要呢。重點是和我見面。{nl}那麼我就在柯拉佩達等你。

QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000025	女神的敵人就是我們的敵人。{nl}那麼我們柯拉佩達見。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000026	您來了啊！你的信仰之心很虔誠。{nl}給了我很多靈感。{nl}這是我的一點心意。請用在正確的地方。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000027	以前很清幽的這個地方現在因為怪物出沒而不得安寧。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000028	不管那個怪物的話牠會攻擊聚集而來的靈魂並且將之汙染。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000029	不管怎麼說那些傢伙數量總算有減少，我心情是有好一點。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000030	許多人們把家人的骨灰盒埋在這個地方。{nl}現在都被怪物們給挖開，就將骨灰盆改成安置在地面上了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000031	有一陣子常常能聽到先人們悲傷的啜泣聲… 一段令人懷念的時光。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000032	還是有很多無法回收的遺物，但幸好還是守住一部分的遺物。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000033	其他貓頭鷹雕像必須引導的靈魂們正往這裡來。{nl}關口附近一定是出事了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000034	不知道發生甚麼事，總覺得我們好像被騙了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000035	不愧是魔族啊！{nl}正干擾著這裡的清靜。

QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000040	大家都向更深處去尋找貓頭雕像了。{nl}能否幫我們逃出這裡呢？
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000041	怪物為了吸收靈魂而追上來了。{nl}被牠們逮到的話會被邪惡力量感染。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000042	太感謝了！{nl}可以找機會逃跑啊…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000043	依依不捨的靈魂
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000044	我都知道。{nl}先行前往北邊的靈魂們沒辦法到達目的地的。{nl}不過可利用其他貓頭鷹雕像幫助指引方向。{nl}但我因為丘陵上方的吉伯優南瓜精沒辦法去…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000045	怪物們為什麼要追著我們跑啊…{nl}好累喔…死也不要…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000046	你說的都是事實嗎？{nl}真叫人生氣…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000047	沒別的辦法了。{nl}我先告訴你那靈魂的去向吧。{nl}往北邊前進有個貓頭鷹雕像。先到那裏去看看吧。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000048	等牠們湧進之前想趕快離開…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000049	神聖的貓頭鷹雕像
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000050	不久前才被變異的死亡魔特斯攻擊。{nl}再這樣下去我的木製身軀會被粉身碎骨的！
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000051	我不想再讓您拜託我保管的骨灰盆或靈魂迷失方向…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000052	體型雖小卻是很心狠手辣的一群傢伙。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000053	雖然感到悲傷，我們雕像現在無法執行雕刻家給予的任務。{nl}只能在一旁保護他…{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000054	你該負責的靈魂太多了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000055	真是優秀啊！
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000056	請往南邊走吧！{nl}可以找到像我一樣的破碎雕像的。

QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000060	您目睹的怪物就是把我們逼到絕境的幽靈范托群。{nl}為了阻止怪物橫行，必須清除空空的貓頭鷹。{nl}幽靈范托群正利用陷阱。{nl}必須至溪谷深處確認空空的貓頭鷹雕像。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000061	靈魂前往尋找貓頭鷹。{nl}但被空空的貓頭鷹給吃掉了。{nl}這傢伙很清楚靈魂在來找我們的路上會迷路。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000062	我以為這些雕像都會被利用…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000063	你見到的靈魂所說的地方就是它們為了來找我們貓頭鷹前來的地方。{nl}現在這裡則到處充滿了幽靈范托群安裝的陷阱。{nl}幽靈范托群陷阱對誰都是種威脅。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000064	靈魂迷路的話會去找其他靈魂。{nl}靈魂就是這個時候會掉入發亮的陷阱。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000065	好多陷阱啊…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000066	應該就在持有鑰匙的幽靈范托附近啊… {nl}真奇怪！
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000067	必須清除附近的幽靈范托群牠們才會出現。{nl}不出現的話就硬拖出來。

QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000073	用鑰匙打開關口的門吧！{nl}指引靈魂的領路人靈魂就在關口的對面。{nl}那個靈魂會幫助你的。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000074	靈魂中偶爾會有人不想接受指引，而留下來幫助別人。就是不同類的靈魂。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000075	領路人靈魂
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000076	你好！{nl}啊…原來是活人啊！
QUEST_UNUSED_20150317_000077	我也錯過了接受指引的時間了。但是我可沒有因此而墮落。{nl}在你來之前，沒有我必須指引的靈魂，我正想放棄呢。{nl}現在請幫我打開關口吧！{nl}還有請告知對面的貓頭鷹雕像這裡非常安全！

QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000295	很久以前魔族和女神們就有股力量維持著他們之間的平衡。{nl}只要彼此不侵犯對方的領土，那股力量就會守護著他們。{nl}但是有一天，魔族先破壞了這樣的平衡下了石化詛咒而導致今天這樣的局面。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000296	多處皆有裝置石化探測器。{nl}您剛剛看到的第一台探測器以順利啟動，再請你檢查剩下的探測器。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000297	希望探測器能順利啟動…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000298	啊，原來是那樣啊！{nl}有兩台故障了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000299	有關探測器啟動問題問還是問王國軍比較好。{nl}他們就是安裝探測器的人。{nl}去找王國軍將校蕾堤亞問問看的話應該幫得上忙吧？

QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000305	{nl}可以幫我找找看他們嗎？
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000306	看來還是沒消息…可能遭遇到甚麼不測也說不定。{nl}如果你有發現他們的屍體的話，能不能幫我上下翻找看看嗎？{nl}應該會出現有用的物品。或是在周圍的怪物身上…
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000307	我常看到沿岸要塞入口一帶的石化霜，在那裏可能被怪物攻擊過或是被石化霜擊中。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000308	支援兵力都被擊中了啊…真可惜！ {nl}以後也得指引他們的靈魂了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000309	是的。總之請帶著那些零件去修理探測器吧。{nl}我們有事在身，無法離開崗位。請多多諒解。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000310	那些東西是零件。{nl}現在該去修理探測器了。{nl}請小心石化霜。

QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000312	那麼就拜託你了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000313	喔全數都能正常啟動了！{nl}非常感謝。{nl}現在我可以安心指引靈魂了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20150729_000314	有點擔心靈魂的數量過多…{nl}但我還是希望可以安分地引導他們。{nl}願啟示者的路上充滿了女神的祝福。

QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000455	[侏儒怪與月亮]
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000456	{nl}{nl}這故事不是百分百屬實，只是眾多流傳下來的傳說其中之一。根據我們所知，侏儒怪因為與利迪亞夏班下了賭注，而飛向月亮去了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000457	{nl}到達月亮之後，過著辛苦四處飛行的日子。但是到達月亮的時候，侏儒怪剛好發現一個嚴重的問題。自己騎乘前來利迪亞夏班的弓箭狀態並不是很好，甚至很難稱它為弓箭了，可見有多嚴重。
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000458	到剛才為止自己搭乘的(其實只是姿勢看起來很像騎乘，他是用魔力來飛行的) 整個弓箭突然呈現嚴重被腐蝕的狀態，而他自己也嚇到了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000459	[侏儒怪與利迪亞夏班的弓箭]
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000460	{nl}{nl}當然來到月球已經過了好一段時間，是有可能發生那種事的，但身體一離開弓箭，正要將弓箭射向月球表面時，竟然發生這種事情，對侏儒怪來說也是很荒唐的事情。
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000461	{nl}弓箭會變成那樣都是侏儒怪的錯。侏儒怪利用魔力讓弓箭飛行、保存在月亮上，不過利迪亞夏班的弓箭具備最初抵抗魔族的最高尚的性質。侏儒怪卻不知情，在騎乘弓箭的同時不斷消耗那魔力讓弓箭飛行，雖然飛行同時一邊看著弓箭，離開弓箭的瞬間，魔力也被切斷，那麼依靠魔力維持飛行的弓箭就好像生鏽的物體瞬間變成鏽粉一樣正漸漸消失。
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000462	[侏儒怪在哪裡]
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000463	{nl}{nl}侏儒怪仔細想了想，雖然了解箇中道哩，但還是太遲了。當然這故事不過只是一個不管是人類、女神還是魔族皆無法親自證實是否為真的傳說，說不定現在侏儒怪還正在飛向月球的路上呢。
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000464	{nl}也許利迪亞夏班為了尋找那剩下的弓箭躲了起來，也許他在某處迷了路也說不定。

QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003224	真的嗎？{nl}鬆了一口氣。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003225	在這裡調查讓人膽顫心驚。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003226	幸好。{nl}這些應該是沒問題了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003227	怎麼會…怪物躲起來了啊。{nl}即便如此還能平安回來真是太幸運了。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003228	外城壁核心回收作戰(1)
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003229	正在和其他奎波爾們說調查的內容
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003230	怪物們好像非常具威脅性的樣子
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003231	一點也不危險
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003232	外城壁的證據保存
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003233	在那之前一起逃吧
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003234	外城壁核心回收作戰
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003235	和奎波爾密爾達對話
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003236	看來得要調查一下外城壁的核心，到外城壁第9區域找奎波爾密爾達。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003237	奎波爾密爾達說核心有多重保護，而且怪物多又具攻擊性，這件事不太容易處理。為了安全的調查，請消滅周圍的怪物。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003238	周圍的怪物已消滅至某種程度，回去找奎波爾密爾達。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003239	奎波爾密爾達好像有話要說，和奎波爾密爾達對話。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003240	消滅外城壁第9區域的怪物
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003241	奎波爾密爾達說如果怪物不小心誤觸外城壁的裝置而導致裝置運轉會很危險，請在問題發生之前消滅怪物。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003242	跟奎波爾密爾達報告
QUEST_UNUSED_20161005_003243	已充份消滅怪物，請告訴奎波爾密爾達。

QUEST_UNUSED_20161214_003249	聽說最近夏奧雷伊東部森林有幽靈在搗蛋。{nl}當然幽靈退散也是我的專長之一，這次就把機會給你吧。{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20161214_003250	士兵們為了補給，在東部森林各個補給地放了箱子。{nl}但箱子裡的東西卻神不知鬼不覺地消失了，這一定是幽靈作的！{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20161214_003251	給你這靈驗的粉末，把它們灑在箱子內就能趕出幽靈。{nl}我在這裡等你。
QUEST_UNUSED_20161214_003252	嗯，真期待年輕人的實力啊！

QUEST_UNUSED_20161214_003255	因為我靈驗的粉末變弱的幽靈叫出怪物就逃了呢！{nl}第一次考驗順利通過了，年輕人！{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20161214_003256	能通過偉大的終結者閔希豪森的考驗真了不起！
